## What is Obfuscation?

**Obfuscation** is the obscuring of code by making it difficult to **read**, **understand**, and **use**. 

Manyland uses **obfuscation** and **minification** to prevent users from making **mods** (short for **modifications**) and to decrease file sizes for faster loading.

## Manyland's Obfuscation

Manyland uses **obfuscation** by renaming important object, variable, and function names to random numbers preceded by a capital O. 

The randomly generated names will change every update, which results in making mods useless if **deobfuscation** was not utilized.

An example of **obfuscation** in Manyland is the **player object**. The name of the **player object** in version 5798 of manyland.js is ```ig.game.O65```
